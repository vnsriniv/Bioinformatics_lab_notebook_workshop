# Atom Basics
I won't cover all the features of Atom (mainly, because I am not an expert). But what I will try to do here is to empower you with some basics so that when you use the power of google, you know some basics.

## Installing Packages
This is, according to me, one of the best features of Atom. Since it is an open-source software, there are several packages that have been created by users and developers.

To install packages, you first use the shortcut `Ctrl+,` to get to the Settings page and then go to the `Install` tab to install new packages.

Lets search for a few packages that I found useful.

1. **atom-csv-markdown** : This packages can transform comma-delimitted tables to markdown format. This is extremely useful since a lot of output formats in bioinformatics are in tab-delimited or comma-delimted formats and it is easy transform between the two in the command-line.

2. **markdown-image-helper** : This package can help insert images into your markdown directly from your clipboard. No need to save to a file and then put it into the appropriate folder!! Yay!

3. **markdown-toc**: Enabling inserting table of contents.

4. **markdown-preview-enhanced**: Real time preview for your markdown document.

These should be enough for now for some basic functionality for our lab notebook. If you require something, just google it and you will probably find that somebody has figured out how to solve your problem by creating a package for you.

**Aaah! the beauty of open-source software!**

## Using Git with Atom

Using Git with Atom is as simple as pressing `Ctrl+9`. If you have already initialized git tracking in your directory as we did before, any changes you make will appear as unstaged changes in the right panel.
