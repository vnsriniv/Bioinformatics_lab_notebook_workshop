# CompBio Lab Notebook Workshop

We will use a combination of [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/). The idea is to use Atom to create lab notebooks (Markdown files) and git for version control.

## Installing Git
It is possible that git is already installed on your computer. To check if it is, go to your terminal or command line and type in the following

```
git --version

```

If you don't get an error, you are golden.

If you do get an error, please go to this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and install git on your computer.

## Installing Atom
Atom is an open source code ditor (developed by GitHub) with built-in support for Git and GitHub. It has handy packages which make Markdown creation and editing quite easy.

You can install it directly from their [website](https://atom.io/).

## Agenda

1. What are the important features for a lab (wet/dry) notebook?

2. What are some unique requirements for a bioinformatics lab notebook?

3. My previous attempts at a bioinformatics lab notebook

4. Using markdown and Atom for creating a bioinformatics lab notebook

5. Using Git for Version Control

6. What is this missing? Can it have the "reproducible" descriptor?
